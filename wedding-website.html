        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Like most love stories today, this romantic tale begins in the wonderous land of tinder. 
        I (Daniella) moved to Orlando to live with my best friend, Elie. 
        Both of us being recently single (and after some convincing) she made me a profile and helped me navigate the classy world of online dating. 
        Eventually I came across, “your one stop shop for dad jokes,” written in a profile and definitely wanted to know more! </p>

        <p>It was thanksgiving break from college and we were both out-of-town. After two weeks of talking (and probably too many dad jokes) 
            we had both found someone who we couldn’t wait to meet and didn’t want to wait another day. 
            I drove back after a night around the fire with some friends the same day she flew back from Miami. 
            Although I tried to make it in time to get cleaned up, she still says that bonfires always remind her of the first time we met. 
            It’s been six years full of love and excitement and we can’t wait to celebrate our day with our friends and family. </p>
